# Introduction

Welcome to the AbiPy Jupyter Book!
This book contains notebook-based documentation for [AbiPy](https://github.com/abinit/abipy).
This augments our Sphinx-based [documentation](http://abinit.github.io/abipy>) with jupyter notebooks 
containing interactive tutorials and examples.

Additional examples are available on the:

* [AbiPy plot gallery](http://abinit.github.io/abipy/gallery/index.html)
* [AbiPy flow gallery](http://abinit.github.io/abipy/flow_gallery/index.html)
* [Matgenb website](https://matgenb.materialsvirtuallab.org)

Beginners should typically start with the three notebooks on Abipy objects,
continue with the notebook on the GSR.nc output file (and possibly some of those focusing on other output files),
and then examine the flows notebook.


## Abinit + AbiPy Lessons

This section discusses flows and vizualisation tools for the same topics 
as some standard ABINIT tutorials.
Usually, the corresponding ABINIT tutorial has to be followed first. 
Sometimes there is also a large overlap with some of the previous AbiPy tutorials.
